👋 Hi, I’m Richard! Currently, I work in quality project management within the Defence Industry. <br>

📊 I'm excited to transition into data analytics, and aim to demonstrate my proficiency in data cleaning, analysis, and visualisation through this Github repository. <br> 

🔗 Let's [connect on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardshi1/) to explore collaboration opportunities! <br>

💪🏻 Interesting fact: When I'm not diving into data, you can find me at the gym or indulging in books on self-improvement and entrepreneurship. <br>
